This project is a custom DNS server that can be updated during runtime through a web UI. 
To persist the routes, a [Bolt](https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt) database gets used for its simplicity and lack of external dependencies.
The project is written in Golang for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend.
