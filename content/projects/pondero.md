Pondero is a mental health oriented social networking website that allows the user to self reflect and communicate with others around the world.
Pondero provides many features, our prime one being a sentiment analysis and mood tracker.
The tool scans users' posts or diary entries and creates a graph to display the user’s ‘happiness levels’ over each month.
Another feature is the ‘positivity’ toggle: users have the option to view more positive posts, which gives the user flexibility over improving their happiness levels and giving them a sense of control.
The website also encourages users to drink more water and exercise, aiming to improve the mental health of users in a multifaceted manner.

This project was built for NASA's [COVID-19 Space Apps Challenge](https://covid19.spaceappschallenge.org/).
It uses a JavaScript frontend with Firebase for the backend.
