A simple browser extension to save and load a window's tabs to a file. 
This was really only made for my personal use, but it's public for anyone else that finds it useful.

The tabs are exported to a JSON blob where they can then be copied and saved to a file.
Tabs can be loaded by pasting the JSON string into the extension window.
