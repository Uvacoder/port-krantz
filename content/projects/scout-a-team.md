A service for [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) teams to simplify scouting competitions and matches.
For those not familiar with FRC, scouting is the process of analyzing a team's performance over matches and even competitions to determine your strategy.
Typically, scouting is a complicated task that is ignored by less experienced, and sometimes even very experienced teams, since it is not strictly necessary to win and relatively complex.
Scout a Team aims to simplify scouting by making it plug-and-play for any team, while also making the data collected as accurate as possible by comparing scouted data across teams.
