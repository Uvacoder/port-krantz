A simple bot for managing an online hackathon over Discord.
All data is persisted in a Redis instance to ensure maximum efficiency give the small amount of data.

The bot was created for [Silicon Valley Hacks](https://siliconvalleyhacks.devpost.com) which was run by a friend and I in late April 2020.
It contained features for moderation, team management, and requesting help from mentors.
The hackathon itself was quite successful: we had roughly 300 participants from around the world with 60 unique submissions.
