MailGunner is a web app that enables [MailGun](https://mailgun.com) to act as a full email service.
It supports sending and receiving plaintext and HTML emails, combining messages into threads, and sending schedules messages.
Messages can be composed using a rich-text editor similar to that of GMail or a traditional email client.

The application is built using the [Django](https://djangoproject.com) framework in Python with a PostgreSQL database.
There is multi-user support with authentication being handled by Discord via OAuth.

This was built for the [WaffleHacks](https://wafflehacks.tech) hackathon which is occurring from July 9th to 11th, 2021.
