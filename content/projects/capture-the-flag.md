A continuous multiplayer capture the flag game built with [BabylonJS](https://babylonjs.com) and [Golang](https://golang.org).
BabylonJS is the rendering engine and physics stimulator that was used.
The multiplayer server is written in Golang and loosely based off of a much older of mine project called MMOS.

This was created during my junior year for my Advanced Animation class with a close friend.
