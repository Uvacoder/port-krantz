Hello! I'm Alex Krantz, and I'm an electrical engineering undergraduate student at University of British Columbia.
This site serves as my blog and project list, where I write about projects I've been working on, tutorials, and any random thoughts I have.
Most of my projects and problems I'm solving are in the web-development realm, though I am also very interested in system administration and hardware.

When I'm not doing school work, I like to work on my personal projects, game, go on bike rides, and alpine ski.
I mostly play resource-management and bullet-hell games, though I do like my fair share of FPS games.

I'm currently looking for a paid internship for winter 2022 and summer 2023.
My resume can be found [here](https://krantz.to/resume) and you can email me at [alex@krantz.dev](mailto:alex@krantz.dev).

Thanks for visiting my website!
